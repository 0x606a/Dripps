# Dripps
A community-driven social event dapp that helps individuals to find nearby activities, and formations.


# Origins
With the advent of DeSoc,  an innovation among the thriving and growing web3 community, we have come to an understanding: of the importance of the union of the creative economy and community-oriented approach. We at today's growing web3 communities, and we see the optimistic collaboration that serves a common mission toward greater causes. To strengthen social community ties, one should consider supporting the web3 ecosystem principles that develop in on-chain relations.

That's why we want to present Dripps! It's a community-driven social event management app that guides you to your community!
